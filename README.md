# Joshua Davis - Code Sample

### Hello, Thank you for visting my page 

## Explanation of Files

### There are two folders 
1) The data retrieval folder is an example of work I have done gathering data from the EPA and Congressional transcripts. For the EPA data, I pull every annual summary of their Air Quality index data from 1988 to 2022. For the text analysis, I used simple NLP packages to analyze the sentiment of three different committee hearings in the Energy subcommittee of the House to identify popular topics and the mood of those particular hearings. Visualizations are also included within the code. 
2) The basic plots folder just includes very simple plots I produced from the Chicago Open Data Portal to visualize grocery access and the number of entrants per each L station.
